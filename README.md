# 🚀 **Project Title:**  
**Transfer Learning for Medical Image Classification**

---

## 💡 **Motivation**  
In medical imaging, obtaining large, labeled datasets is often challenging due to privacy concerns, high annotation costs, and limited availability of expert knowledge. To effectively learn and boost performance on these smaller datasets, we leverage **transfer learning techniques**, which consist of models that are trained on huge amounts of data.

## 🗂️ **Repository Structure**  

### 📁 **Results Folder (`deal_project`)**  
This folder contains the outcomes of all tasks (**Task A** to **Task D**). The results are saved in the following formats:  

- **📄 Terminal Logs**: Outputs from terminal runs during model training and evaluation, providing insights into model performance metrics like accuracy, loss, and validation scores over epochs.  
- **📑 CSV Files**: Detailed results are saved as CSV files for each task.  
- **📊 Figures**: Visual representations of the results, named according to their respective tasks.

### 📂 **Fine-Tuned Models**  
This section includes pre-trained and fine-tuned weights for the following models*:  

The size of the models was relatively high, so it was decided to upload them to the drive

- **VGG16**  
- **EfficientNet-B0-1**  
- **EfficientNet-B4**  
- **ResNet18**  
- **ResNet34**  
- **DenseNet121**  
- **DenseNet161**  

*We have studied these models with and without incorporating **attention mechanisms**.
