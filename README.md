Project Title:

  Transfer Learning for Medical Image Classification

Motivation: 

  In medical imaging, obtaining large, labeled datasets is often challenging due to privacy concerns, high
annotation costs, and limited availability of expert knowledge. To effectively learn and boost
performance on these smaller datasets we leverage transfer learning techniques which consist of
models that are trained on huge amounts of data.

Project Overview:

  This repository contains all the necessary files, results, and scripts for the project to improve diabetic retinopathy detection using fine-tuned deep learning models. The project explores transfer learning techniques applied to medical imaging datasets. 

Repository Structure

1. Results Folder (deal_project)

This folder contains the outcomes of all tasks (Task A to Task D). The results are saved in the following formats:

Terminal Logs: Outputs from terminal runs during model training and evaluation, providing insights into model performance metrics like accuracy, loss, and validation scores over epochs.

CSV Files: Detailed results are saved as CSV files for each task, including predictions, evaluation metrics, and model parameters.

Figures: Visual representations of the results named according to their respective tasks.
